# detectionSim
R code to run simulations that test for issues with variable detection in three SDMs (a PA data SDM, a PA+PO data SDM, and a PA+PO+Gear data SDM).

# Initialise simulation ...
To initialise the simulation, run the R code in "setupSim.R" (may need to change directory settings and get packages that are used by this code).

# Run experiments ...
To run simulation experiments, use the "startHere.R" file.
